    <li>Clone this repo/download the files </li>
    <li>Download the add ons from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CVWZeJZiCjq32vg5fwXDC4CNOiRVAqIK?usp=sharing">here</a> (the .tar files) into the same directory as these files</li>
    <li>Download the file "datacentral-1.0.0 Setup.exe" into the same directory as the other files</li>
    <li>Run "Server.exe"</li>
    <li>Run the "datacentral-1.0.0 Setup.exe" file by clicking on it twice to open the GUI interface</li>
    <li>Choose "Configure network" if you wish to run datacentral on that computer or you can run Server.exe on one computer and run the GUI on another computer using "Connect to network"</li>
    <li>Create an account at localhost:3000 and create a pod called "poddy" to use the solid based add ons</li>

  <h1>The future of datacentral</h1>
 </summary>
   I dont plan to make datacentral open source as I feel that would compromise the security of the system as any given malicious actor could work backwards from the source code to exploit vulnerabilities. Instead I will release a set of files that detail the endpoints of each add on and what type of data that endpoint receives. This will enable users to create their own add ons and as long as they have the same endpoints they can replace the default add ons and the whole program will still be completely functional. 
 In terms of the immediate future of datacentral I will be working on modifying my add ons to work visually with files as opposed to file chunks. I also have plans to integrate a side project I have as a new add on and I wish to create an add on that handles running local llms.
