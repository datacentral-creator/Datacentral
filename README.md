What is datacentral
===================
As the name suggests the core idea of datacentral is supposed to be the "central" for your data acting as a self-enclosed ecosystem that allows you to fully transform your data from a passive resource into projects for example similiar to how wood is transformed into a table - as a tree wood isnt particularly useful for humans however when transformed into a specific object such as a table a tree becomes a thing by the purpose and form we give it.
